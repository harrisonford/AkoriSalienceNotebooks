# AkoriSalienceNotebooks

This project is a collection of jupyter-based, akori-project reports regarding saliency tests on a 
free-viewing web-page/user environment. Our main objective is to explore and create a machine-learning 
oriented algorithms able to predict user's eye-behaviour that are specifically optimized for 
different environments such as webpage behaviour.
